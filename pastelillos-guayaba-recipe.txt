Ingredients:
 - 1 pkg. Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry Sheets
 - 1 bar guava paste
 - 1 pkg. Cream cheese (optional)

Directions:
 1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

 2. Thaw the puff pastry according to package directions.

 3. Use baking parchment to line your cookie sheet so the guava won’t stick.

 4. Unfold one of the pastry sheets and place on pan.

 5. Cut guava into 1/4 inch slices and place on the pastry sheet.

 6. Spread cream cheese over guava paste slices (optional).

 7. Unfold second pastry sheet and place on top of guava paste. 

 8. Cut to desired size before baking.

 9. Bake at 400 for 25 to 35 minutes or until golden brown.

 10. They will look absolutely irresistible, but (seriously, trust me on this) use as
 much self-control as you can muster and give them time to cool before taking that first bite.
